# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

The Culinary Collab is an app for discovering and sharing recipes both a home and industry environment. Users are intended to be able to create, edit, duplicate, and share recipes for both food and drinks. In this sprint, we participated in a Cognitive Walkthrough and produced Wireframes to better understand our users.

## Methods

Cognitive walkthrough:

During our cognitive walkthrough, we tasked participants with probable use cases within The Culinary Collab website using our lower-fidelity wireframes. During this cognitive walkthrough, each participant took on a user persona and goal-oriented task created in phase I. From the persona and task, the participant worked through each step using the wireframe as a proxy for the application. Additionally, they were asked to document their walkthrough answering 2 questions along the way per each step;

Question 1: Will the user know what to do at this step? 

Question 2: If the user does the right thing, will the user know that they did the right thing and is making progress toward the goal?

## Findings

### Cognitive Walkthrough
Usability engineers from outside of our team performed cognitive walkthroughs of our wireframes on our three personas, Solomon, John, and Billie.

#### Solomon
From the Solomon cognitive walkthrough, we learned that we should:
- Change Workshop to Discover or something to indicate it’s where you find new recipes
- Make the search field look more like a text input
- Include wireframe for filter box, show kinds of options it has
- Have the “add recipe plus button” give feedback on interaction
- Add list view to “My bar” in addition to carousel or provide some sort of list on the side to quickly jump to recipes

#### John
From the cognitive walkthrough on John, we learned that we should:
- Include a heading for the Inventory section under “My bar”
- Include search and filter section for ingredients
- Within filters for recipes, filter option for recipes by recipes the user can make with their ingredients
- Move search and filter CTA buttons to the top
- Add wireframe for how to add an ingredient (text box pops up in ingredient list with check button for confirming)
- Create wireframe for workshop recipes page
    - Change plus to “copy/duplicate” (duplicate icon)
    - Add edit button (pencil icon)
    - Add delete button (trash icon)
    - Change “New Template” to “New Recipe”
    - Create wireframe for “New Recipe”
    - Include confirmation “Added to my bar”

#### Billie
From Billie's cognitive walkthrough, we learned that we should:
- Create login, landing, sign up pages to start on (starting page unclear)
- Create wireframe for navbar -> hamburger menu w/ sub-categories
- Add navigation link to Inventory
- Add quantity field for ingredients

## Conclusions

While our app is showing promise, our Cognitive Walkthrough showed some weaknesses we had not previously considered. Our wireframes lacked some major portions of the website, which will need to be added prior to prototyping. Additionally, some conventions were ignored or missing in places that it would have made sense to make use of them. From the other side, after meeting with our software team to align, we found that some of our efforts may have been misdirected. We now have better guidance on what we need to do to further assist the development of Culinary Collab.

## Caveats

While we have some new direction after this feedback, it is important to note that all of it came from either students in the UX class with familiarity in the language of Usability Engineering, or Software Engineering Students, who are familiar with the more technincal elements. This could open us up to blindspots in our direction, that we will ideally resolve in the final phase with our research study.
