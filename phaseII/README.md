# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

The Culinary Collab is an app for discovering and sharing recipes in both a home and industry environment. Users are intended to be able to create, edit, duplicate, and share recipes for both food and drinks. In this sprint, we participated in a Cognitive Walkthrough and produced Wireframes to better understand our users.

## Methods

Cognitive walkthrough:

During our cognitive walkthrough, we tasked participants with probable use cases within The Culinary Collab website using our lower-fidelity wireframes. During this cognitive walkthrough, each participant took on a user persona and goal-oriented task created in phase I. From the persona and task, the participant worked through each step using the wireframe as a proxy for the application. Additionally, they were asked to document their walkthrough answering 2 questions along the way per each step;

Question 1: Will the user know what to do at this step? 

Question 2: If the user does the right thing, will the user know that they did the right thing and is making progress toward the goal?

## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
